# Titanic---Machine-Learning-from-Disaster

The Titanic data analysis is a very famous problem in data analytics. This is an active competition on Kaggle.
In this project, I have analyzed the dataset of passengers onboard Titanic to predict which passengers would survive the disaster.
The data analysis has been done using R.
I studied thorugh the video tutorials of Mr. David Langer and have developed this code following his tutorial.
I am learning R by myself and hence this was more of a learning experience for me,
Once again, this is not my own logic or code, I have simply followed what he teaches in the tutorial.
